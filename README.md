Lorky - Video Player is a safe and and lightweight video player for surfing on videos.

The videos list are updated weekly from all approved channels. Please visit lorky.com to see which channel are added. For adult we have a forum to request channel change or to report any inappropriate content. 

The need to create that application came from one of my son which his autistic. During COVID lock-down it became a headache to manage his playlist items. To have video from only approved channels was important to me. 

Lorky - Video Player don't collect any user data and we don't advertise. It's totally free.

Lorky - Video Player is multilingual.

To add language we will have a forum's section for adult to discuss approved channel. It's something I will let the community decide to be sure only safe channel will be added. Please visit lorky.com to know when that forum section will be available.
